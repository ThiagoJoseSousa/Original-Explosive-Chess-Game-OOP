# Explosive Chess
## Description
Explosive Chess Game is a chess variant that introduces a new element of strategy to the game. Players have the option to choose between a sword attack and an exploding attack. Unlike Atomic Chess, which only allows exploding attacks, Explosive Chess offers both options. This results in a faster pace than traditional chess and adds an extra layer of complexity to the game.

## Goal
I heard a lot about Object Oriented Programming, so I made this project focusing on following the OOP principles. In my [first project](https://github.com/ThiagoJoseSousa/Explosive-Chess-Game) of this game my focus was to improve my Javascript logic, so more rules were working, such as choosing the team and player vs AI (Minimax/Alpha pruning).

## What I learned

In this project, I've learned a lot about SOLID, and DRY and a bit less about abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance. Some Javascript methods such as Object.assign and object loops were unknown to me as well. Webpack was used to bundle the JS files. 

## How to play 

Open the link, enter single-player mode, and despite the team choice, you play both sides.
The difference appears when a piece attacks.
