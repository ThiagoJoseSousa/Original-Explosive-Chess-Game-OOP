This was my first time trying to do an OOP project... I've learned a lot about SOLID, DRY and a bit less about abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance. Some methods (as Object.assign and class syntax in general) were unknown to me as well. As my project grew, I had seen myself with 4 arguments in some functions, and more ifs to come. So I decided to pause this project while I study a bit more, or at least have some learning goal with the project.

Thank you for reading!
